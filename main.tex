\chapter{Introduction}
The advancement and widespread use of heigh-throughput experimental 
technologies in the field of plant biology have introduced significant 
challenges in managing and analysing the vast datasets effectively. Addressing
these challenges require innovative methods that maximize the data utility 
while mimnimizing computational inefficiencies and resource consumption, ensuring
robust insights into complex biological systems (https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/6856/machine-learning-in-plant-science/articles).



The understanding of interplay between plant physiology and its hidden biochemical process is crucial for the improvement of basic plant science and addressing global challenges such as food security, crop resilience and combating climate change [1]. 
In recent years, advanced High-throughput analytical techniques such as Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) has instigated a paradigm shift in plant biology [2][3].
These High-throughput techniques are mostly used in areas like genomics, imaging and spectroscopy and is known for their ability to collect and analyse the data faster than traditional techniques[3].
