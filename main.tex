\chapter{Introduction}

The understanding of interplay between plant physiology and its hidden biochemical process is crucial for the improvement of basic plant science and addressing global challenges such as food security, crop resilience and combating climate change [1]. 
In recent years, advanced High-throughput analytical techniques such as Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) has instigated a paradigm shift in plant biology [2][3].
These High-throughput techniques are mostly used in areas like genomics, imaging and spectroscopy and is known for their ability to collect and analyse the data faster than traditional techniques[3].
High-throughput techniques are widely used since they enable the efficient collection of vast amount of data at various scales, from molecular to field level over significant time periods[4].
The massive amounts of data collected through this techniqes presents both opportunities and challenges to scientific communities since it requires efficient processing to generate useful results in limited time frame and this is where Machine Learning (ML) becomes indispensable.
ML algorithams can analyse complex, high-dimentional datasets, enabling accurate predictions of plant traits or other features based on the input data on study. By integrating the Big data from high-throughput instruments with machine learning, reserchers can optimize data processing pipelines, enhance predictive accuracy and there by enter into a new ear of data-driven decision-making [4][5].
